#  Configuration file defining how afterburner works
#  This configuration file may be subject to change. Remember to check if the new versions are compatible with
#  your old afterburner configuration files
#  Afterburner is based on a folder shared with the machine that will run the Minecraft server.
#  It will take everything you need from the folder, copy the data and paste it locally.
#  First of all it cleans the folder (deletes everything), copies what it needs from the shared folder and pastes everything
#  locally so that everything is executed locally. At the end of the execution nothing is deleted so that an analysis at the end
#  of the execution is possible.

#  DON'T TOUCH THIS !!!
