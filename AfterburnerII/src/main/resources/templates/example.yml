#  This file is generic and unique for the template you will order.
#  We recommend, for example if you have an on-demand server network, to create a template for each game mode.
#  This template will adapt depending on what you tell it.
#  This configuration file may be subject to change. Remember to check if the new versions are compatible with
#  your old afterburner configuration files
